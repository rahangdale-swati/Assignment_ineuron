## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
-Python language is in human readable format and with the of interpreter it will convert into binary langauage. i.e in the form of 0 1 0 1.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
-In python, varaiable datatype is determined while runtime.So thats why python called a dynamically type language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Pros- Easy to use
    - Open source
    - Lots of in built library
    - Good Speed and performance
    - Python code will be run on any platform
Cons- Python is not 100% secure.We need to put some extra efforts to ensure the code security.
    - Many problem aries when we setup a work environment.It will affect for begginers experice related to programming.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
-   Mobile Application
    Game development
    Data Analytics
    Web application etc

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
    Variable is nothing but the name of specific memory location.
    Declaration int_var= 10

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
    With using input function we can take input at the runtime from user.
    name=input("Enter the name")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
    Default data type as input is String.

Q8. What is type casting?
-   Type casting is nothing but convertion of dat type fron one to another. 
    for eg- Int to float

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
    -No,we cant take multiple inputs from user by using input funtion.

Q10. What are keywords?
-   Keywords are special symbols in any langauge.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
    -We can't use keyword as a variable as they have some predefine meaning.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
    Indentaion is nothing but a Space.It helps in python to represent the block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
-    With the help of print() function we can throws the output.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
     Operators manipulate the value of oprands.
     In Python there are different oprators-
     -Arithmatic operator(+,-,*,/ etc)
     -Logical operator(AND OR NOT)
     -Comparsion Operators(==.=!,>=,<=)
     -Bitwise operator (&,^,~,|)

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
     '/' is not true division and not floor division.
     for Eg- if both the arguments are float the result will be float and both value are integer then output will be integer.
                int_var=5/2
                    print(int_var)--> 2.5
                int_var=5.2/2
                    print(int_var)--> 2.6
                int_var=5//2
                    print(int_var)-->2
                int_var=5.2//2
                    print(int_var)--> o/p 2.0
     

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
        string_aa="iNeuron"*5
            print(string_aa)
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
    int_num=int(input("Enter the number="))
if(int_num%2==0):
    print("Number is even")
else:
    print("Number is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
    Boolean oprators gives the output in form of True and False.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 --> 1

0 and 0 --> 0

True and False and True --> False

1 or 0 or 0 --> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
    - Conditional statements works on the different conditions. 
        Below are the conditional statements.
        If,If else,If elif else, for etc

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
        If condtional statement checks only one condition,elif condition checks one or more condition,else condition selects the default one.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
    age=int(input("Enter Age:"))
if(age>=18):
    print("I can vote")
elif(age<18):
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum = 0
for i in numbers:
    if not i %2:
        sum +=i
print("Sum of even number is=",sum)
```
Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
    num1=input("Enter the value for num1  ")
        print(num1)
    num2=input("Enter the value for num2  ")
        print(num2)
    num3=input("Enter the value for num3  ")
        print(num3)
    if(num1>num2) and (num1>num3):
        print("num1 is greater",num1)
    elif(num2>num3):
        print("num2 is greater",num2)
    else:
        print("num3 is greater",num3)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
---------------Code---------
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if(i<500):
        if(i % 5== 0):
            if(i<150):    
                print(i)
```
